# PSN Export Transaction History

This extension add to Chrome Dev Tools a new PSN Transactions panel that allows you to export your transaction history to the CSV file


## Why?
Because Sony did not provide the ability to export data by regular means.

## Is this legal?
It uses the same http requests as the website, the extension catches the site's requests and repeats them several times until all the data is received,
so most likely yes, it is legal.

## How to use?
Log in to your account on the PlayStation site (https://www.playstation.com/),
click on "Account Settings" link in the user menu, open Developer Tools in your Chrome,
click on the "PSN Transactions" tab, go to "Transaction History" of your account settings,
after downloading the data (may take several minutes), a button for downloading CSV file will appear on the Developer Tools panel.
Click on the button to download the history of your transaction history.
